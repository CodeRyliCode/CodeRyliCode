I am grateful to exercise my brain at any possible chance I get. Learning is such a privilege and it is my duty to always remember that. I've made a transition from the Hospitality career life to the world of tech. I started learning JavaScript a few years ago becuase I was in a meditation Sangha, and all of the teachers either worked for Google or were software engineers. Every day, I become more capable in solving complex challenges and I increase the value that I am able to give back to others around me.
