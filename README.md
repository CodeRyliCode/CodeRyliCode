### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ryli :)

Every day I am exercising my mind, learning new concepts, and decoding challenging problems. The main language I have experience with is JavaScript. I am at a proficient level in regard to programming with React.js. My level of skill for Node.js is also steadily increasing. 
I started learning JavaScript a few years ago because I was in a meditation Sangha, and all of the teachers either worked for Google or were software engineers.
That really made an impression on me because I knew that if I could focus my mind to achieve self-awareness then I could focus my mind to take a huge leap in learning something new such as software development!
Every day, I become more capable in solving complex challenges and I increase the value that I am able to give back to others around me.
