### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ryli :)

I'm a front-end web developer who specializes in designing and implementing features based on customer feedback while releasing weekly features to production. I have a deep investment in the success of my organization, and I take personal responsibility for my decisions, actions, and quality of work. I am proactive and collaborative, and I work across org boundaries effectively. I am also a quick learner who asks clarifying questions to discover and learn the details of not just my assignments, but also the adjacent areas.
