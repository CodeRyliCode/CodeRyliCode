### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ryli :)

I want to exercise my brain at any possible chance I get. Learning is such a privilege and it is my duty to always remember that. 
I've made a transition from the Hospitality career life to the world of tech. 
I started learning JavaScript a few years ago becuase I was in a meditation Sangha, and all of the teachers either worked for Google or were software engineers.
That really made an impression on me because I knew that if I could focus my mind to achieve self-awareness then I could focus my mind to take a huge leap in learning something new such as software development!
Every day, I become more capable in solving complex challenges and I increase the value that I am able to give back to others around me.
